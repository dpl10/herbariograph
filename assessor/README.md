# DATASET

The dataset was constructed from a variety of public data sources detailed below. Each image was manually reviewed and a total of 8,192 images per class were randomly selected: 7,168 train, 512 test, and 512 validate. The file XXX details the origin of each image.

## Illustrations

Vascular plant illustrations were sourced from the [Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL)](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/). Collections of images were manually downloaded via a [curated collection of Flickr albums](https://www.flickr.com/photos/biodivlibrary/albums). Downloaded images were further processed to remove nonâ€“vascular plant images as well as to segregate images into color versus monochrome/grayscale classes. 
<!-- First run: no maps, portraits, landscapes, and altered or natural photographs, fungi, physiology diagrams; Second: Code Color vs. Gray; Third: 65.4% ok in color; additional cleaning (maps + yellowish and sepia appearance) -->

# INFORMER MODEL ARCHITECTURE

The Informer architecture is a based on the Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT; [Hassan et al 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05704)) modified to include an image tokenizer and token reducer inspired by Inception ([Szegedy et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261v2)) and SqueezeNet ([Iandola et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360)). For greater computational efficiency, a mixture of conventional transformers and poolformers ([Yu et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11418)) have been employed. Thus, the name *Informer* is a combination of *In*ception and Trans*former*.

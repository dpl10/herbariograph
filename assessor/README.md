# INFORMER MODEL ARCHITECTURE

The Informer architecture is a based on the Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT; [Hassan et al 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05704)) modified to include an image tokenizer and token reducer inspired by Inception ([Szegedy et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261v2)) and SqueezeNet ([Iandola et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360)). For greater computational efficiency, a mixture of conventional transformers and poolformers ([Yu et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11418)) have been employed. Thus, the name *Informer* is a combination of *In*ception and Trans*former*.
